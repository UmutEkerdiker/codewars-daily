// We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

// What ways of achieving this do you know?

//--My Solution--

//There are so many ways to achieve this. I simply used toString method in JS.
//For example, we can create an empty string and add the number to it. Or just use template literals.
function numberToString(num) {
  return num.toString();
}
